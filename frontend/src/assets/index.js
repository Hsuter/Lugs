        "SPEECH OF THE HON. NABII DARAJA NABWERA ON THE OCASSION OF THE INAUGURAL EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS’ CONFERENCE HELD AT THE SALVATION ARMY HALL—THE SALVATION ARMY OFFICERS’ TRAINING COLLEGE, TURBO ON 4 NOVEMBER 2022",
      speech:
        "Your Excellency the Governor of Kakamega, Hon. Fernandes Barasa, MCAs from Lugari and elsewhere present, principals and heads of schools, members of boards of managements of our schools, representatives of churches which sponsor our schools, ladies and gentlemen; I take this opportunity to thank you all for heeding the call of the Lugari Educational committee, which indeed is my call, to congregate here as leaders in the education sector. That we are here, in the first place, is something that we should all be proud of since it represents our willingness, as a family, to review the status of the education sector in our constituency.Your Excellency, I am very humbled by your presence here today. To me, it is not only a vote of confidence in my initiative to revive education in Lugari, rather it is a symbolic gesture of your readiness to partner with us in this venture. The objective of this meeting is to bring together all players in the education sector. We are here for self-evaluation; to take stock of our achievements and to identify gaps in our practices and; above all, to identify opportunities for pushing to new frontiers by way of formulating new strategies that will lead to improved education outcomes among learners of different levels in our constituency. I will start by making a few personal and honest reflections as a way of inviting you on this journey. I belong to the generation which had the privilege of accessing basic education in the 70s and the 80s. I am glad to note that I went to ordinary public schools both in primary and secondary. If I went back to Kivaywa High school now, I will identify the dormitory I slept in. From primary through my secondary school, I would say I went through the hands of good teachers. I wouldn’t have known it then, but as a parent with children in different schools and as a member of parliament, I know that so much has changed in as far as attention to learners is concerned. Equally, so much has changed in as far as the image and responsibility of the teacher is concerned. During our days tests were fewer and much of the time was spent on teaching. During that time there was nothing like ‘motivation fee’ which now is at the core of the discussion on performance. During my time, the honour in teaching was much more associated with the impact a teacher had on learners; teachers who would mentor learners to greater success were the celebrities in this sector. And as far as I can remember, teachers were the heroes of our communities. And I am sure if we took stock now, those same teachers managed to bring up successful families. During that time, children belonged to communities; there was a communal concern as to why a certain child was not attending school. And yes, during that time, the chiefs, their assistants and village elders took a leading position in mobilizing communities not only to build schools, but also to ensure that children spend time in those schools. Village elders were regular visitors in school, they knew which parent was delaying to pay fees and they understood what to do to make that parent to pay fees. But that was then, fairly golden days of our education. I campaigned for election on the promise of leading a robust discourse on how to transform lives of people in our constituency. A key pillar in this transformation is the education sector. I had some good idea what this sector looked like. I have spent the last few weeks moving in schools, particularly secondary schools to just understand the state of this sector. Your Excellency, I am sorry to say that the education sector in Lugari is in a deplorable state. There is both structural dysfunctionality and what I may call a general lethargy that characterizes this era. Callousness and general insensitivity and laxity to duty is the new fashion. It is difficult to see astuteness by the way learners look like. Attempts by the government to democratize education management by inviting various stakeholders to nominate members to boards of management haven’t helped matters, either. One would be forgiven to conclude that our communities, churches and various leaders haven’t taken the initiative of contributing their best to the management of our schools seriously. Politicians like myself have used educational spaces as avenues of rewarding their supporters at the expense of the learners. These are our sins, and I wish to just provide a tip of the iceberg of what these sins have caused.I have done a quick survey of secondary schools in Lugari. Your Excellency, my constituency is one of the very few in this country privileged to have two sub counties. In Matete sub-county, 17 secondary schools presented learners for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the just ended education circle. We had 1505 candidates registered for this important exam. Out of these, a paltry 171 making 11.7% scored the minimum university entry grade of C+ and above. But look, out of these 171, 114 came from just two schools, meaning the remaining 15 schools share 57 successful students. We end up with every school having contributed 3—4 students to university. On the other hand, we have grades which are just very difficult to utilize because you do not easily get a training or job opportunity that consider these grades as qualifications. These include D, D- and E. In Matete sub-county, 631 candidates scored these grades translating to 41.9%. In other words, though there is evidence of investment in such learners, at the end of their learning circle it appears like the learning/ teaching practices never impacted on them in a helpful manner. Consider Lugari sub-county: 34 secondary schools presented candidates for the same examination. A total of 3033 students sat for the exam out of which 419 or 13.9% candidates scored university entry grades. In the infamous category of students with very low grades of D plain and below we had 1435 students or 47.3%. But even more concerning, three schools in this sub-county did not take a single candidate to university. Things aren’t better for primary schools: the regimentation in our system makes it even harder for learners completing primary schools to maneuver and get good secondary schools. This means that the only ticket to a good secondary school is a good mark at KCPE level. The mean mark for a KCPE candidate in my constituency is below the official KCPE average. If we asked anybody to identify a pupil from our public primary schools who secured a slot in any of our national schools, you will hardly get any. But what is even more alarming is that a huge number of these pupils score just between 100—200 marks. This is a tragedy of a monumental level. What does this say: for all our commitment to leadership, for all our professionalism, for all our claim to parenthood, for all our salaries as educational officers, we have all united in creating our schools an academic graveyard for our children. We are all guilty. Your Excellency, I cherish your presence here today because I would like you to be a partner in revamping the educational standards in Lugari. As you can see, this is an extraordinary situation which can neither be cured by habit or ordinary constitutional provisions. We will need to stretch ourselves and overreach guidelines of financial allocations to attend to this problem. I am already facing the direction of ensuring that for the first three years of my term, over 60% of money allocated to CDF will go to education. But for this to be productive, I will ask some specific lines of cooperation with other stakeholders.To start with, the chief executive officers of our learning institutions: Principals and heads of primary schools will have some role in the way we will distribute bursaries. As most of you may know, there have been murmurs of misappropriation of bursary funds in Lugari. Now let me be open, nobody who was mentioned to have been close to the team that misappropriated CDF money or bursary funds will be allowed to move closer to the new constituency offices. Government money cannot be appropriated by individuals for personal development. Once we come up with the responsibilities of various stakeholders in the identification of needy students and allocating of bursaries, I expect nothing less that equity and fairness. Heads of institutions will further be required to help in managing other resources associated with revamping school infrastructure. I would like to ask that you be our eyes; not conduits of theft or accomplices in sleaze. Get this: in my time, there will be nobody to follow a CDF cheque to ask for a fraction of it back to my office. Any such person who will come in my name or in the name of whoever, will be a thief and treat him or her as you treat thieves of livestock in your communities. Let’s work according to laid down government guidelines and social values that will take our communities forward. But more than this, make your schools safe and attractive spaces of work. I urge you to treat your staff, learners and parents with utmost respect. Boards of Management: you know your briefs. I am perturbed, though, that in some schools BoMs are more responsible for the challenges that are there as opposed to offering solutions. It’s your duty to secure more resources for the school; kindly join me in looking for these resources. We are prepared to work with the current boards to achieve as much as possible. Going forward, however, I will encourage those who nominate these boards to ensure that they give us the best people who can build our schools. This is the truth: a chain is as good as its weakest link; if we have a board member who cannot contribute to the development of the school then the nominating authority will have led down that particular school. You are a leader if you can speak to the problems of your times. In the ongoing debate on the CBC for example, a BoM member who cannot pronounce themselves on any aspect of this new curriculum is simply occupying someone else’s seat. Please my people on the boards, you are the schools’ links to communities—ensure that you build good relationships between the school and the various stakeholders. These stakeholders include various leaders. Let me remind you; you always outlive the tenure of principals. You are the government dimension of the school and to this effect do not allow our schools to be run down.Boards of management have parents’ representatives. My observation is that parents need to take a more commanding role in the lives of their children. And I need to state this: time when teachers knew better the needs of their children are over. It should concern a parent that he hasn’t paid fees. Parents’ representatives should work closely with teachers to ensure that all parents meet their obligations including fee payment and meeting other obligations. Please let’s make the work of our school administrators easy.I would like to conclude by reiterating my commitment to developing our schools. I am asking my fellow elected leaders in Lugari to synergize; let’s adopt ideas that work. I want to ask them all to invest wholeheartedly in education. No leadership will last or even leave a legacy if it undermines schools and teachers. Politicians who underrate players in the education sector are pretenders to power. Let’s look at the larger spectrum of education including adult education where some of our people are trying to have a second chance in their lives. MCAs: please support programmes in adult literacy as well. We need a community that is well informed. Out of this meeting, my team will develop a report that will maintain a high fidelity to your views and sentiments on how we should move forward. Provisionally, I am ready to initiate trial programmes with three schools in every ward with the objective of identifying best practices which will improve learning outcomes in our schools. Schools are being selected depending on their preparedness and their state of need. My idea is to lessen the financial burden from parents; to motivate learners and to inspire teachers. In those selected schools all form fours will be boarders—we will work out the logistics with the respective school boards. My thinking is that learners should spend as much time as possible within the school compound. My vision is that we should not lose even one good pupil in the primary to secondary transition. We will support all students but those with higher potential will be our golden eggs; we will take care of them more tenderly. As you leave this place, tell those children to work hard because we are ready to support them. Let us tell the teachers who did not make it to this place to work hard because whereas our support to school programmes are guaranteed, institutions which will post higher results will attract more resources. And I need to stress this, teachers initiating creative teaching and administrative practices which translate into higher national scores will not go back home empty-handed. Such teachers will be motivated and we shall stand at vantage positions to shout about their goodness such as to draw the attention of the employer to their performance. As we go home, let’s encourage young people of school going age to choose school over staying at home. For very needy families but with bright children let’s promise them that help is nigh. For I pledge to you now that we will spare no resources as long as there’s a life to transform. Finally, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to the administrators of this wonderful facility—the officers in charge of the Salvation Army Officers’ Training College—Kenya West Territory. The ambience of this place is just what we needed. You have been great hosts, indeed. Given the context of our meeting, I hope the congregation will be fired up as they go forth on their mission to transform Lugari. May God continue to maintain you in His Wise keeping. And to you all, thank you very much.",

      speech:
        "Ministry of education officials, members of the clergy present here, our dear students, teachers, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take this opportunity to; first, thank God for enabling all of us to be here this morning. Six months ago I was in this community to share my vision with you as I was asking for the mandate to provide leadership in this Constituency. I still remember how you received me and how you responded to my message of transformation of our constituency. For reasons I cannot exhaustively explain here, I hold Lwandeti as a special place in my leadership. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the most important programme on a key issue in my manifesto will be launched here. We are here in Lwandeti to launch the Lugari constituency scholarship and bursary programme. This morning we will give full scholarships and bursaries to our young people so that they can go and study. And my hope is that the clergy present and all of us will bless these children. This I ask of you because my team selected these boys and girls competitively and most of them are from very needy backgrounds. As you see them here, each of them carries the dreams of their families. They are expected to come back quickly to rescue their immediate families and even other relatives. So these scholarships and bursaries are not really just about these boys and girls; they are also about many other people in this generation and in future whose lives will be touched by these boys and girls. They are like a candle which will light many other candles going forward.Brothers and sisters, before we say much about the Lugari NG-CDF bursary programme, I wish to state that the basis of selecting eligible candidates was mainly performance in the 2022 KCPE and KCSE examinations. But having been briefed about the performance of our children in these two major examinations, I would like us to reflect on their import on the status of our schools and our society in general. If I have to focus on the 2022 examinations only, I can describe academic performance in Lugari as despicable despite the fact that we have a few excellent grades. On a positive note, I wish to recognize heads of primary schools whose pupils qualified for national schools. In the same vein, I wish to salute principals who gave us students with at least A- in KCSE. You are our trailblazers! Ladies and gentlemen, we know that we had thousands of students who sat for these two examinations in Lugari and the majority did not score grades which would give them a competitive edge in further studies. In fact, many are mere beneficiaries of the 100% transition. The tragedy of such a model is that we could be having thousands of students who may not even know why we are pushing them to the next level. Such students may not only have failed to master the examinable content in the curriculum but they may also have failed to appreciate the socializing role of education. It means the system they have gone through failed to give them the necessary spark that could ignite a sense of ambition. Sometimes we see this when parents and teachers are the ones running around to fill bursary and scholarship forms instead of the students themselves making these applications. And so to you students who are here with us this morning, I would like to now direct that where you are headed, it’s your personal drive which will save you. As you join new institutions, get to know what is right for you and fight within the regulations to get it. Now on the performance in the 2022 KCPE and KCSE: It’s not lost on me that when last I said teachers should take responsibility for the failure of students, one leader of the teachers’ union criticized me in good faith. In fact he said teachers are doing very well. And having taken time to move in our schools and to attend boards of management meetings in some instances, I would partly agree that teachers are trying to do a lot of work and also in difficult circumstances. But I will be dishonest if I don’t mention that as stakeholders—political and administrative leadership; teachers; the ministry officials and sponsors of schools, we aren’t doing enough to support our students. And I want to use this opportunity to highlight a few failings in our responsibilities. While moving around our schools, I was alarmed at the state of infrastructure. Both learners and teachers are sometimes operating in environments that undermine their human dignity. Many buildings are condemned yet they are still under use. In some schools learners are either in temporary structures or they sit under trees. This, ladies and gentlemen, has been so much because of our failure as the political leadership and national administration. We are guilty. In my meeting with heads of primary schools from the entire Lugari Constituency on 12th of January, I committed myself to embark on a programme of improving school infrastructure. Given the extent of need on the one hand and the limited resources on the other, we resolved that we will give priority to institutions in greatest need. Dr. Jaluo Murunga you will remember that you led us in resolving that we should give attention to schools with mud-walled buildings and condemned structures. I wish to assure all of you that a robust implementation programme is in place. It may take a bit long because of the slow flow of resources from Nairobi, but I want to state again that we are going to build our schools to completion. Classrooms will not only be properly finished, they will be painted because our children, these children, deserve to sit in a beautiful environment. Now to you teachers: I will still adopt the tone I took last and say, you have not done us proud. Let me start by declaring that my vocation as a father—and a responsible one for that matter-- and a leader in many capacities has given me an opportunity to interact with many teachers across this country. And let me say this, there is nothing inadequate with the training of teachers who are posted in Lugari schools. I also cannot say that our teachers could be having very personal or even health problems which teachers in performing schools of the caliber of our own do not experience. Some of you may know that I am in two key education committees in this country as a legislator and I can confirm that our teachers are paid just like their colleagues elsewhere in schools which could be posting better grades. But look, some of our teachers may even have come from schools which perform very well but once they came here, it’s as if they retired. I may not be a specialist in assessing how our teachers execute their duties but I wish to once more call upon them to think about our children. If it cannot disturb you when you think of your students as their teacher, please think of them as their parent because some of you are, indeed, parents. Think of them as young siblings, will you sustain them with their future families? You could be privileged to have a health cover, how do you want them together with their families to access health services when they grow up? If you can’t teach out of duty, sympathize with their state now, some of them are orphans already or they come from households which cannot afford two decent meals a day. These are children who make effort, sometimes they bathe without soap because they are trying to upgrade their sense of humanity to your own before they come to your classes, why do you forsake them? It grieves me when I hear that we still have the callous attitude of teachers sitting in staffrooms to reflect negatively on students without any intention, whatsoever, of putting such learners on a sure path of success. Will your legacy be your sheer memory of the schools you taught in?  Will it be just the wealth you make out of teaching as a trade?  Will you remember your days of working just by the way students used to come with good grades and you release them with Ds? Where is your conscience when, year in year out, you give a mean of D and you don’t take yourself to the quality assurance office for assistance? How many of poor people’s children should perish in your hands before you give space for a better person to attend to them? As I said, I am a father, and my experience-which may not be so rich- has convinced me that the spirit and commitment of a teacher matters. If you ask those of us who were in high school in the 80s we will easily tell you who stood tall among our teachers. Just like a good shepherd who knows the smell of his sheep, I implore you teachers to know the challenges of your learners. Yes, I know you will say you are overwhelmed by numbers but strive to support your learners. Let it not be said that such and such a pupil would have passed if he had been in good hands yet it’s you who handled that pupil. Teachers: you are to these pupils and students what doctors are to patients. These parents can just be desperate onlookers but deep within them are prayers you will never decode. Please answer the prayers of these parents by supporting these young people.Heads of schools: we have had an opportunity to share our vision with most of you, particularly heads of primary schools. And soon I am going to meet principals of our secondary schools to establish ways of supporting their institutions. As heads of our schools I wish to assure you that we have a lot of confidence in you. Upon your solid foundation of professionalism a school’s vision is framed. But I wish to say, take charge of schools effectively because as leaders we are not going to accept half-heartedness in the management of our institutions. The days when a head of a school would say such and such a teacher is the reason why we didn’t do well are over. Why do you wait for them to waste my students before you tell us such stories? We are not oblivious to the challenges you face and the sacrifices you make as heads of schools. In fact we say, thank you for the good work so far. All we are saying is that we still see very serious gaps in your management of schools and the low grades posted so far are just one manifestation of the greater dysfunctionality of your institutions. Sometimes when I make remarks like these, some people say that I am trying to micromanage schools. Let me make this clarification my dear heads of schools, when you have challenges of resources and you present them to me, I will always knock on the doors in Nairobi to help solve them. In fact I want to once more promise that you will never walk alone. I go to Nairobi to present your grievances because I represent you. But don’t forget that as principals you are part of the executive in this country, and thus as a legislator I can legitimately oversight you as well. In conjunction with the office of the DQASO, therefore, we will be conversing with you with a view to improve performance in our schools. Do not be surprised when, very soon, we develop keen interest in the particular practices you have instituted in your schools. I am keen to understand the academic culture of every single school within Lugari. As chief executive of these institutions, I will want to understand the road map put in place to implement the curriculum effectively. When I visit your school, I will be happy to understand how you monitor the implementation of the curriculum in every single subject and for every class. It’s not too much for me to also ask for your mechanisms of formative assessment as envisioned in the CBC. Most important, I will want to see how you deal with any signs of learning not having taken place—what is your redress? In the 2022 KCSE, for example, the mean in each of the science subjects and Mathematics in the constituency is barely 2. Where will these learners go with such a grade? If they miss to secure university slots, which STEM course can they do in any of the tertiary colleges? Do these parents understand that you mostly give them back children who may never be turned into professionals? We ask you heads of schools to do better. We need every school to have a strategic plan. With that single document, we will see your vision and the mechanisms put in place to achieve various goals within stated periods. In short, as a head of the institution we will expect you to really understand your school at all times and to take absolute responsibility for whatever happens there.I am happy for the support I always get from our education officers. It is not everybody who will sacrifice their time to attend to a function like this over the weekend. I am particularly grateful because I am aware you have had a very hectic time this opening week but you still honoured our invite. My plea to you is that you continue to support our schools. I have tried to appraise myself with what you do every day. I have also tried to listen to communities in Lugari and to the teachers who are your immediate clients. I have visited you and sometimes our interaction has not been as good as it should be. This is expected particularly where there appears to be a huge discrepancy between our vision and what seems to be practically taking place. Communities are asking that you supervise schools more closely. Some voices are asking that you should encourage heads of schools to deal with administrative problems in a manner that will result in the greater good of the community other than self-preservation of the individual school administrators. The teachers are asking that you be fair. Advise them on how they can grow; remind them whenever there are opportunities for promotions and help to prepare them for interviews. We respect your offices and we will support your work, but we also want to hear that your interpersonal relationships in those offices are collegial.Parents: much as we are supporting your children, we are not replacing you. You remain the parents of these children and we expect you to actively mentor them. If your child is on full scholarship, thank God but help us by being close to your child. In case of need for you to go to your child’s school, do not miss, otherwise we will withdraw the scholarship. The truth is, we sacrificed other children and other families to help you, the least you can do is to coordinate with teachers when required. For children on bursaries, ask your parents to complete the remaining amount before the end of the year. With a positive assessment report and your parent having completed the remaining fee, you automatically qualify for a bursary next year. My office will rely on returns from principals, so behave yourselves accordingly. If your family will fail to meet this important obligation of completing the remaining amount, you will not qualify for any bursary from us again. In fact, you will be blacklisted. My vision is not only to support students but to support my schools as well. Anybody undermining this vision will be cast aside.Lastly, I want to just emphasize that promoting education was a key intention in my manifesto. My commitment to my promises is exemplified by the budget we have allocated to this function. This year alone, over 372 students have benefitted from our full scholarship programme. These include students joining national schools this year; those who had been recommended by the regime before us and were already on full scholarship; and, orphans. I said this: any child without a father or a mother, I will be the parent.  I asked my team to diligently comb our villages to identify children in these categories and I am happy to see that they accomplished this task. Before you are 201 young people who are not lucky to be feeling the warmth of their natural parents. We are going to support them through their studies. For you all, who are here, support me in ensuring that we run this initiative with utmost integrity. Let it not happen that among these children we have one whose mother is a rich businesswoman or whose father is an MCA. Scholarship and bursary money will go to the deserving cases only.I have a special category of beneficiaries: an entire stream at Kivaywa boys (they can stand); a stream at Bishop Njenga Girls (they can stand); a strean at Mukuyu (they can stand); and, we have 25 girls at Lukhokho girls (they can stand). This is my initiative to support some of the best students from all our wards but from our best schools within Lugari. As you can see, our dream is not only to support these children, but also to support our schools. To the special schools with which we have this arrangement: I would like to say THANK YOU. But together with a word of gratitude, I wish to remind you that you have a very delicate responsibility. These girls and boys are my own. We entrust you with them because we have confidence in you. Yours are not just schools, they are formation centres. We submit them to you after they have passed examinations, we will not accept even just one of them back with a grade lower than what they come with (we will equate the grades professionally). Please discuss as a school and get a way of making these students to qualify for competitive opportunities ahead. For those in colleges and universities, you are the first borns in this family. Take it upon yourselves to lead an exemplary social life. There will be an occasion later this year when I will have a big festival climaxing in a colleges and universities expo. I will want you to be part of my collaborators in organizing that inaugural function. Leave your contacts with my staff and take their contacts as well, you will be my ambassadors. And to you all students, to select any of you, someone else had to be left out. In Economics they call it opportunity cost. We had to sacrifice someone to support you. Seize this opportunity and use it well because it is a rare one. In my Facebook post about this event I said ‘Education is a Game Changer’. It’s, indeed a game changer. There used to be a popular advert of a beer which used to say ‘It makes us equal, it has no equal’ (I think because everyone who drinks gets drank). Now I want to say it’s education which makes us equal, it has no equal. In the coming few years the heads of our schools will be from this cohort, doctors will be from this cohort, education officers will be from this cohort, a motivation speaker will be from this cohort; and, perhaps, even a member of parliament will be from this cohort. All to the glory of GOD. Thank you all and be blessed. ",
